# Supported resolutions
CATS supports the following resolutions natively:
- 1920x1080
- 1280x720
- 3440x1440
- 5120x1440

There is also experimental support for any resolution with these aspect ratios, though some things may not work and haven't been tested:
- 16:9
- 43:18
- 32:9

If you have a supported ultrawide monitor and CATS isn't working, try changing your cursor to "OS Cursor" in the ED graphics settings.<br>
If you want to get your monitor supported, join the Discord and send a message in the resolutions thread.
